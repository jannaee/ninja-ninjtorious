			<h3>How I plan to survive the</h3>
			<h1>ZOMBIE</h1>
			<h2>APOCALYPSE</h2>
			<h4>in three simple techniques</h4>

		<div id="content">

			<div class="box1">
				<ul>
					<li><h3><img src="images/skull-image.jpg"/></h3></li>
					<li><h3>Shelter</h3></li>
					<li>It's time to draw inspiration from the Somali pirates. The key for great shelter is out in the ocean and all you have to do is hijack a boat or two. Look for the ones that have been abandoned by people or overrun by zombies. Zombies can be easily tricked to walk off the plank.<li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="box2">
				<ul>
					<li><h3><img src="images/pigeon-image.jpg"/></h3></li>
					<li><h3>Food</h3></li>
					<li>Beggars can't be choosers. Go for weak, small prey. Pigeons are slow and plentiful, they provide fat and taste like chicken&mdash;er um, so I believe that's what it would taste like. As for veggies? while on land scoope up clovers. They are a highly edible and great source of potassium  which can help with the <em>runs</em>.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="box3">
				<ul>
					<li><h3><img src="images/krav-logo-image.jpg" /></h3></li>
					<li><h3>Weapons</h3></li>
					<li>You should always have three types of weapons. Something for long distance like a knife. Another type of weapon should be used for mid-range and hunting, like a machette. However, the most important skill will be what you know for short range combat ie, fist fighting&mdash;thats why I learned Krav Maga. </li>
