# ZAPPPOS!

Here's my official submission for the [Zappos.Code{} project] (http://zcode.zappos.com/). 
My [repository] (https://github.com/jannaee/ninja-ninjtorious.git) is available for your review.
Please treat my baby well as it is the result of 9 days of sweat, tears and hallucinations from days of no sleep.
I love your company and most importantly Tony Hsieh's philosophy. I want to work for that guy for life! 

I want to build mobile apps and I strongly need/desire your help. I have great ideas and really need the tools (lessons by an expert developer) to bring them to life.

## Zombie Survival Guide
Thanks for this one. I've been reading about responsive for a while but it is not in use where I work yet. 
I like how 3 simple views add up to a useful site for all.

### Todo List
  * Create a dynamic form that takes input and provides specific output
  * Integrate with Google's Map of the Dead

## Good Ninja - Sort Thyself
This was a stretch for me. I've done work on my own to better understand Javascript but it was great to see how JS and CSS can work together
and the compromises made for cross browser compatibility.

### Todo List
  * Write text over book images
  * Write own sort function
  * Try to look like iBook UI


## My Video
It's me! Hope that the bonus points for under 5 min help :)

### Todo List
  * Not sure I'd change this, it's me
  * Might cut a minute and go over the completed work

## DragonWood
Get lost in the dream that could be DragonWood

### Todo List
  * Map of DragonWood
  * Illustration of Dragon coiled around Ft. Knox vault
  * Drawing / edit of dragon with 1st person cameras looking bored like on movie set
