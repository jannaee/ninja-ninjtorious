					<li><h5>The requirements as I understand them are:</h5></li>
						<ul>
							<li>- Requirement 1: Create a Zoo</li>
							<li>- Requirement 2: House Two or More Dragons</li>
							<li>- Requirement 3: Dragons are Safe</li>
							<li>- Requirement 4: Dragons are Healthy</li>
							<li>- Requirement 5: Customers Alive and Happy</li>
						</ul>
						<br/>
						<li>Prologue: If I believed in dragons along the J.K. Rowling story line, the task of building a 'zoo' would be based on force vs. force to keep dragon and human separate and happy. Design would have focused on materials (heat resistant ceramics, transparent metals [aluminum], fire breaks, and more) and counter measures (temperature control, water cannons, directed energy weapons, ...). Overall dangerous work but us Muggles could have muddled through it.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>Instead, I believe in dragons of Middle Earth. Cunning, strong, noble and magical - there is likely no set of barriers that could be created that would keep zoo patrons safe from their wiles. Zookeepers could fall under the dragon spell and be forced to let them free. Their size and strength would be difficult to contain and without an ample supply of magic Black Arrows they would be difficult to dominate physically. But fear not hopeful dragon pimps, there is hope. In fact, Zappos itself is well positioned to make DragonWood a world famous attraction.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>The Vision: While dragons are cunning and full of tricks, one can count on two truths. Dragons are greedy and dragons love gold. Based on these truths, I envision DragonWood being built on mutual interest and economic opportunity and not on restraint as is typical with a zoo. The business plan is based on 6 principals:</li>
							<ol>
								<li>The Economics: Gold has seen a historic 10 year run from under $400 to over $1600 USD/oz. I believe the market is overvalued and headed for a crash. Zappos would keep this plan secret to gain maximum advantage when the price drops.</li>
								<li>The Debt: The United States is at historic levels of debt and will likely have to take extreme measures to retire debt as the costs of borrowing rise. Zappos would stand ready to help Uncle Sam in his time of need. </li>
								<li>The Land &amp; the Gold: The DoD's Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC) identifies bases for closure as our military consolidates. Zappos will need to outfit a small army of K-street lobbyists in the finest of kicks to acquire rights to all of the gold and part of the land in nearby Ft. Knox. The win-win-win public-private-dragon partnership would turn land and a low use asset into a hard currency generator that could be used to retire debt. BRAC could avoid many of the usual downsides as the Army presence would need to remain intact or even grow to ensure the dragons kept their portion of the bargain.</li>
								<li>The Bargain: Well into the 4th Age, man's rise has made life downright tough on your average dragon. Treasures are not what they used to be and they're well-guarded leading to a general lowering of the Dragon standard of living. Knowing their position, Zappos defines a corporate structure that splits ownership and profit evenly between Zappos, the U.S. Government, and best two dragons that it can find. It is also worth noting that the proposal is really a theme park and not a zoo. No self-respecting dragon would be one of many as a zoo suggests any more than Dolly would have been one among many at a place called "CountryWood". These are noble beasts and must be treated as such.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>The Dragons: The Zappos led partnership applies its famous recruiting skills to find the best fit for the team. Dragons are notoriously competitive so Zappos needs to not look for the best individual contributors but instead seek a stable pair of dragons. The profile:
							<ul>
								<li>a)	Married and Happy</li>
								<li>b)	Large enough to repel any dragon usurpers</li>
								<li>c)	Smart enough to understand that a double cross means death</li>
								<li>d)	Motivated enough to understand the incentive of ownership - 20 fireballs a day is not trivial and each one needs to be great</li>
							</ul>
						<br/>
						<li>The Rides: With an expansive entrance and History of Dragons section, DragonWood will initially focus on doing a few things well.
								<ul>
									<li>a) Zappos Dragon Experience (ZDE): Disney will need to change the name of "Soarin" to "Snorin" when ZDE opens. This all ages multi-sensory ride is experienced from the dragon's perspective where each participant feels like Smaug himself flying through the skies, snatching up tasty cows and (simulated) maidens, and a real barn burner of a barn burning. After this combination of audio, video, wind, and fire the only thing that will dampen riders inner fire is a few drinks at the Dragon Grille and Grille. $15 All Ages.</li>
									<li>b) Zappos Dragon's Spine: A 30 mile roller coaster / tour with stops at key points around the dragon's habitat. Each group is certain to see a fireball and at least one tour a day will witness dragon sparring. Estimated Price: $30 Adults, $20 Children over 48", and free for Seniors (seriously if you're chasing dragons at 65+, you deserve a break).</li>
									<li>c) Zappos Dragon Galactic: Offered only twice per year and to only 100 high wealth individuals, Zappos will cater to your every need before and after your dragon ride. Ride with a trained dragon master and even bring a friend. Riders will experience every turn and thrill as the dragon soars, dives, hunts, feeds, and even does battle with a small fleet of Zappos-Army controlled drones. You may not be one or even 68 miles high, this is a much more exciting club to be in. $500K/rider depending on demand. </li>
								</ul>

						<li>And there you have it - part laissez faire and part renaissance fair - Zappos Presents: DragonWood. Zappos does well; our foreign debt and trade deficit positions are improved; and dragons once again have a home worthy of MTV's Cribs. All requirements met and everyone is safe and happy because everyone's interests were considered from day one. </li>
